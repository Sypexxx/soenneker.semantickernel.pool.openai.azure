## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using the Azure OpenAI extensions. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```csharp
using SemanticKernel.Pool;

var kernelPoolManager = new KernelPoolManager();
kernelPoolManager.RegisterAzureOpenAI("YourAzureOpenAIKey", "YourAzureOpenAIEndpoint");

// Add local LLM
kernelPoolManager.RegisterLocalModel("LocalModelName", "PathToLocalModel");

// Set rate limits
kernelPoolManager.SetRateLimit(100); // Set limit to 100 requests per minute

// Use the models
var response = kernelPoolManager.Invoke("LocalModelName", "Your input text");
Console.WriteLine(response);
```

### Configuration Options

You can configure various options in the `KernelPoolManager` to suit your needs:

- **Rate Limiting**: Control how many requests you send to Azure OpenAI.
- **Model Selection**: Choose between local and Azure models based on your requirements.
